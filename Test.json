I bought it for my 77 year old mom who had a stroke and myself.I'm 55 and like many of us at that age my memory started slipping. You know how it goes. Can't remember where I put my keys, can't remember names and forget about numbers. As a medical reporter I was researching the importance of exercising the brain. I heard about BrainAerobics and that it can help improve and even restore memory. I had nothing to lose, nor did mom so we tried it and were actually amazed how well it works.My memory improved pretty quickly. I used to have to write notes to myself about every thing. Not any more. I can remember my grocery list and errands without writing it all down. I can even remember phone numbers now. You have to keep doing it. Just like going to the gym for your body several times a week, you must do the same for your brain.But it's a lot of fun and gives you a new sense of confidence because you just feel a lot sharper. On top of your game so to speak.That's important in this competitive world today to keep up with the younger one's in the work force.  As for mom, her stroke was over two years ago and we thought she would never regain any more brain power but her mind continues to improve. We've noticed a big difference in just the last few months since she has been doing the BrainAerobics program regularly. She's hooked on it and we are believers.Marilyn Mitzel/Aventura, FL", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "AMAZING HOW QUICKLY IT WORKS!", "unixReviewTime": 1228089600, "reviewTime": "12 1, 2008"}
